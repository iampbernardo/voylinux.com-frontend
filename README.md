Design for a node app as my new web frontend

This is an under development design for a :heart_eyes:
new personal web page.

## Idea
  Having a small Express.js app that will render content fetched from my original WordPress installation using WP REST API

  **Why?** I love all the WordPress admin, options and text redactor but
  really dislike it's themes templates with all that ... html and php mixed
  **And also ...** because a NodeJS frontend will work great and it's fun. I love fun.

## Technologies

- **Express** as a NodeJS server.
- **Jade** as the templates engines (works great with express) and it's syntax is sooooo sexy.
- **React** to wrap things in reusable components.
- **Sass** as a CSS pre-processor. (Who writes plain CSS nowadays?)
- **Webpack** to create a bundle with all my styles and JS
